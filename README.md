# Into-the-Wild

The movie Into the Wild illustrates how going out into the unknown can be both thrilling and perilous. This project attempts to address some of the fears people may have when travelling to abroad by providing information about a range of data points, including attitudes to women, violent crime, terorrism, rule of law and corruption.
